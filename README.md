## What is in it
- **Six zones**, each dungeon deeper than the last (3 to 8 floors), a boss at the bottom. Then the **endless galaxy**: new worlds forever, bottomless dungeons, loot you only keep if you get out.
- **Your bug:** health, mana, level, and 5 points per level for Strength, Dexterity, Vitality and Magic.
- **Gear like Fate:** thorns (bite), shells (armour) and charms, in normal, magic (blue) and rare (gold) versions with names like SHARP WASP STING OF LIFE.
- **Spells:** Fireball, Spark, Heal, Shield. Find their books.
- **Buddy, your pet:** follows you and fights. Feed him fish to turn him into a Fire Beetle, Stone Beetle or Stag King. Send him off to sell your spare gear (SELECT on the Gear page).
- **Fishing** in dungeon pools.
- **Unknown berries and seeds** like Fatal Labyrinth, hunger, crumbs, potions.
- **Quests and fame** from your ship's quest board; named elite monsters; wasps that shoot; beetles that hit hard.
- **Your ship:** supplies, a gear shop, selling, healing, and flying on.
- **Warp crystals** open a portal home; the door takes you back to the same floor.
- **Planets from space:** a round, turning world with seas, land, polar ice, drifting clouds, a soft day/night edge and a hazy rim; it keeps the frame rate up when you fly close.
- **Looks:** baked stone, brick, earth, moss, crystal and marble textures, doors, potion niches, plaques, rune bands, torches, smooth lighting with soft corner shadows, water and polished floors that reflect, embers and dust, head bob, chiptune music.

## Build
Needs an ARM GBA toolchain (`arm-none-eabi-gcc`, e.g. devkitARM), `gbafix`, and Python 3 with numpy. GitHub Actions builds it on every push (see the Actions tab).
```
make            # or: make TC=/path/to/arm-none-eabi-
```
Files: `main.c` (planet, dungeon loop, title, main), `dungeon.inc` (level builder, light baking, 3D renderer), `game.inc` (stats, gear, pet, quests), `ui.inc` (screens, shop, saving), `sound.inc` (music and effects), `gen.py` + `texgen.py` (make `assets.h`: palettes, textures, sprites, tables), `crt0.s` + `gba.ld`.

## Space (new)
At your ship, pick **LAUNCH INTO SPACE**.
- D-pad: steer. B: thrust. R: brake. A: shoot pirates.
- Fly close to the planet and press A to land. Fly to the white box (station) and press A to dock.
- Station: buy and sell 8 kinds of goods (prices change by world type), refuel, repair, and upgrade laser, shield and cargo.
- SELECT: galaxy map. Pick a star and press A to jump (uses fuel).
- Beat each zone's boss to open the next star. Beat the Ant King to open the whole galaxy. Then START on the map jumps to a new cluster, forever.
